## Introduction

This project is an analysis on a fake news headline data set we found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification). This is performed as our final project for our course MATH475: Statistical Machine Learning, under professor Soheyl Anbouhi.

We aim to train a model to determine if a news headline is true or fake. We will use a variety of machine learning techniques to do this, including:

- Simple Linear Regression
- Asking an LLM
- ... and more!
