    "For this project, we would like to do textual classification on the *Fake News Classification* dataset on Kaggle. The dataset includes article headlines, body text, and whether the article is \"fake news\" or not. We would like to use a Text Classification Pipeline in python and a Large Language Model to determine which is the better model. The goal is to determine which model better classifies the texts. Here is a [Link to the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification)."
